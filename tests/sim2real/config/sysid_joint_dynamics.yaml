# System Identification Test Configuration
# Conservative parameters for initial testing

experiment:
  name: hanging_test_01

test:
  # Joint to test (11 = Left Hip Pitch, safest starting point)
  joint: 22
  
  # Step response tests
  step:
    amplitudes: [0.05, -0.05, 0.1, -0.1]  # radians from neutral
    duration: 2.0      # seconds per step
    settle_time: 1.0   # seconds to return to neutral between tests
  
  # Sinusoid sweep tests  
  sine:
    amplitude: 0.05    # radians
    frequencies: [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]  # Hz
    duration: 4.0      # seconds per frequency

  # Recording
  record_rate: 500  # Hz (match SDK rate)

# Gains for tested joint (uses common gains from T1.yaml)
active_joint:
  use_common_gains: true  # if false, use values below
  kp: 200.0
  kd: 5.0

# Gains for passive joints (hang loose)
passive_joints:
  kp: 0.0
  kd: 2.0

# Safety limits
safety:
  max_joint_velocity: 5.0  # rad/s - trigger warning
  max_amplitude: 0.3       # rad - hard limit on commanded amplitude
